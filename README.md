# Rust in action code examples

- My source code follow [Rust in action](https://www.amazon.com/Rust-Action-TS-McNamara/dp/1617294551/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=rust+in+action&link_code=qs&qid=1671208706&sr=8-1)

- Hopefully I do it well :D


## Some note ?
- Strings in Rust are able to include a wide range of characters

- Sometime we got errors like: `E0373` we can use command to see more detail: `rustc --explain E0373`
